Below are the steps I would follow in order to design a way to deliver 
data that enables analytics.

1.  Get a clear understanding of the expectations of the Analytics team;
    this can be achieved by soliciting answers to the following questions.
    - How much data will be used in the analysis process?
    - What platforms/tools do they use in the analysis process?
    - How many data sources do they use in the  analysis process?
    - How frequently will the analysis take place?
        -   Will there be need for real time data or batches of data analytics
            predetermined times be sufficient?
    - How many users will be using the analytics platform?

2.  Decide on how data quality will be maintained as it passes through the pipeline;
    this can be achieved by answering the following questions.
    - What does an effective reconciliation strategy look like?
    - What transformations will not be suitable for this application?

3.  Decide on the best solution for hosting the data pipeline;
    this can be achieved by answering to the following questions.
    - Weigh the pros and cons of a cloud based solution vs on-premises.
        -  Is there any existing infrastructure, if yes would be cost effective 
            to utilize it?
        -   How much time is available to perform a migration between solutions
            if the need arises?
    - Identify the classification of the data to be utilized
        -   Is there a need to anonymize the data as it makes its way through the pipeline?
        -   Are there any restrictions on where the data can be stored and/or moved to?
    - How much transient data will need to be stored and for how long can it be kept?   

Once these questions have been answered either through stakeholder engagement and through research.
The next step will be to decide on the appropriate set of tools and technologies and designing an
architecture to fulfil the needs of the analytics team.
